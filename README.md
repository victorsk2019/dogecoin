<<<<<<< HEAD
Dogecoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was inspired by a Shiba Inu meme. The Dogecoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Dogecoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.
=======
For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).

For information about the default fees used on the Dogecoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

## Usage üíª

<<<<<<< HEAD
To start your journey with Dogecoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Dogecoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `dogecoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `dogecoin-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Such ports

Dogecoin Core by default uses port `22556` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `22555` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.
=======
The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository is used exclusively for the
development of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree
repositories. Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork
that repository unless it is for development reasons.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

## Ongoing development - Moon plan üåí

Dogecoin Core is an open source and community driven software. The development
process is open and publicly visible; anyone can see, discuss and work on the
software.

Main development resources:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* [Github Projects](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/projects) is used to
  follow planned and in-progress work for upcoming releases.
* [Github Discussion](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/discussions) is used
  to discuss features, planned and unplanned, related to both the development of
  the Dogecoin Core software, the underlying protocols and the DOGE asset.  
* [Dogecoindev subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/)

### Version strategy
Version numbers are following ```major.minor.patch``` semantics.
=======
There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.
